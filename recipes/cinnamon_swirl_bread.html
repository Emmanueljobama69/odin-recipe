        <h1><em>Cinnamon Swirl Bread</em></h1>
        <img src="./pictures/cinnamon_swirl_bread.jpeg" alt="cinnamon_swirl_bread">
        <p>This homemade cinnamon swirl bread recipe is a family favorite and only requires a handful of basic ingredients. It’s soft and tender with the most unbelievably gooey cinnamon swirl inside!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons (1 standard package) <strong>Active dry or instant yeast</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoons (72g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature and divided</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the yeast and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar together in a large bowl or in the bowl of your stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Heat the water and milk together on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). Pour over the yeast/sugar and whisk until combined. Cover loosely and let sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture is frothy.</li>
            <li>With a wooden spoon, rubber spatula, or the dough hook attachment on low speed, beat in 4 Tablespoons of butter until it’s slightly broken up. Add 2 and 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt. Mix on medium-low speed, then add enough bread flour (usually around 1/2 cup) to make a soft dough that no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl. Knead by hand or with the mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes until the dough is smooth but still slightly soft. Smooth into a ball and place into a lightly greased bowl. (I just use the same bowl. I take the dough out, spray with nonstick spray or grease with butter, then put the ball of dough back in.) Turn the dough to coat all sides. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 1-2 hours. (For this warm spot, I suggest using the oven. Preheat to 150°F (66°C), then turn the oven off after preheating. Place the covered bowl inside and shut the oven door. This is your warm environment.)</li>
            <li>Grease a <a href="https://amzn.to/3XHZVCg">9x5-inch loaf pan</a> with butter or spray with nonstick spray. In a small bowl, toss remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the cinnamon, and raisins (if using) together. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and with a floured rolling pin, shape into a 9×18-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture on top, leaving a 1-inch border around the sides. Roll the dough up very tightly into a 9-inch log. Pinch the ends to seal. Place into prepared loaf pan bottom seam side down. Cover loosely and allow to rise in a warm environment until the dough rises to the top of the pan, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
