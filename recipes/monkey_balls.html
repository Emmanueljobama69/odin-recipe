        <p>big ballsy</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cup (320 ml) warm whole milk, 105 -115ºF</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast, 1 packet - SEE NOTE 1</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups (455 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ¾ teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large measuring cup, whisk the milk, butter, sugar, and yeast together.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly drizzle in the milk mixture.</li>
            <li>Once the dough comes together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and shiny, about 7 minutes. The dough will be sticky. (If the dough is wet, gradually mix in 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until it is no longer wet but sticky.)</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball.</li>
        </ol>
